	* release of 1.4.0-alpha0
	* cleanup of source to remove compiler warnings
	  and switch to c++11
	* failure of making hard links will not delete the deduplicated
	  file, if possible. See Github bug #5.
	* failure of making symlinks will not delete the deduplicated
	  file, if possible. See Github bug #5.
	* added option -minsize to optionally ignore files under a
	  certain size. See Github bug #1
	* add sha256 support - see Debian Bug 815120 and Github #7
	  the default checksum is now sha1 instead of md5
	* better error messages when -dryrun is misused. See Github #8
	  and Debian Bug 754663
	* performance: pruning empty files earlier and other improvements.
	  "rdfind -checksum sha1 /usr /usr" goes from 5.9 to 4.86 seconds on the
	  author's machine, with hot filesystem cache.

	  files.
	* add deterministic mode, enabled by default. See Github issue #13 and
	  Debian Bug 795790. When enabled, makes the program insensitive to the
	  order of files when listing directories.

          due to autotools updates)
